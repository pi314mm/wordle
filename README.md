# wordle

Here is some poorly written code at my attempts to find an optimal solution to wordle. I even have a "bulls and cows" solver which is rather similar, yet a surprisingly different problem.

I have made AN adverserial wordle and A solver, but these are greedy solutions, and thus are not necessarly THE BEST algorithms out there. Whether THE BEST can be found remains to be seen.
